# Compresive Strength of Concrete




## What is compressive strength of concrete?
Compressive strength can be defined as the capacity of concrete to withstand loads before failure. Of the many tests applied to the concrete, the compressive strength test is the most important, as it gives an idea about the characteristics of the concrete.


## Problems Statement
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. I solved this problem using Data science and Machine learning technology, developed a web application which predicts the "Concrete compressive strength" based on the quantities of raw material, given as an input. Sounds like this saves a lot of time and effort right !
